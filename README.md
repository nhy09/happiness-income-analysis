# happiness-income-analysis

Using World Bank’s data of GDP per capita by income and its four-tier income classification of countries, I categorized each country into its income group using nested IF functions in Excel.  I then downloaded the World Happiness Report data and merged the two sources with VLOOKUP to create one dataset containing each countries’ income group and their Ladder Score(happiness indicator).

I initiated this project because I wanted to understand the correlation between national wealth and happiness level, and to explore global inequality quantitatively. After building a dataset linking each country’s World Bank income group to its World Happiness Report “Ladder score”, I made a visualization of the correlation using a scatter plot and a regression line. The graph shows a positive trend, as high income countries have relatively higher ladder scores, while the lower income countries cluster lower. The regression line reinforces the positive trend, suggesting that national income levels are associated with happiness. This project allowed me to see that I can visualize global patterns and trends using  simple statistical analysis, and also helped me realize that economic inequality can translate into disparity in happiness.
